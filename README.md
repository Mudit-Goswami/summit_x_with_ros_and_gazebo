# Summit_X_with_ROS_and_Gazebo
ROS-based Autonomous Navigation and SLAM for a Summit-X Robot in a Gazebo simulated environment using 3D sensor information.

These are the ROS packages from the Robotnik Automation and I have used them and made some changes to these files according to my use.
I have combined Summit-X and the Summit-XL packages to do the Autonomous Navigation and Implement SLAM for the Summit-X Robot.

I'll also upload the video link for my work.
